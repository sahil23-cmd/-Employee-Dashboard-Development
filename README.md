This project involves the creation of an Employee Dashboard to track and analyze key metrics such as sales, commissions, employee names, countries, and employment status (active/left). Using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), I implemented dynamic calculations and measures to ensure accurate and insightful data representation.

The dashboard includes interactive visualizations for better data exploration and decision-making. However, during development, I identified a mistake in the KPI weightage, which initially skewed the insights. This was corrected to ensure the dashboard aligns with business objectives.

Key Learnings:

Importance of validating KPI calculations and weightage.

Balancing detail and precision in data visualization.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
